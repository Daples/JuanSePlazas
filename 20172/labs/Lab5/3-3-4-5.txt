3.3 This exercise is really straightforward becuase, when we write a tree in 
pre-order, we immediately know that the first integer is the root, the next 
integers are the left ones and, then the right ones. So, first we insert the
first integer which is the root; then, as the tree is a binary search tree we 
know that if we insert them in another BST, it will insert them in the right 
order if and only if we insert them in the order they are given. So, just
inserting them as the user passes them solves this problem.

3.4 The complexity of 2.1 is O(nlogn)

3.5 n is the final quantity of integers written in preorder
