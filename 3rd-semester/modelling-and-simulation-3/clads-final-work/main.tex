 \begin{abstract}
	In recent years, cryptocurrencies have become an important part of the financial and economical market all around the world; a big portion of this success is due to their efficient and decentralized transaction system. Even though they were developed for a more trust-worthy financial system, one that does not depend on banks or governments, there have been organizations that had taken advantage of this and other key factors of today's society, such as social media, news, etc. In this paper, we approach the transaction system of cryptocurrencies using system dynamics for a more wide study of how this currencies can increase their price only with a constant flow of investors and transactions. A dynamic hypothesis and Forrester diagram were constructed after defining some relationships between the variables that were considered relevant in the system. The model was validated and some policies were proposed in order to achieve some limits in the prices of cryptocurrencies.
