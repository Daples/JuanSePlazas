\section{Introduction}
In the 1920s, Charles Ponzi duped investors when he convinced them that he will return a 50\% revenue every 90 days; he was actually paying the old investors with the money given by the new ones. This is known as the Ponzi Scheme nowadays; since the virtual currencies lack of regulation and have enhanced privacy for trading, they can be and are being used by fraudsters to perpetrate their frauds in similar fashion \cite{ponzi}.

\noindent In 2017, the cryptocurrency company BitConnect launched its new coin BitConnect Coin (BCC, not to be confused with BitCoin Cash), which assured every user that whatever investment they made in their currency and made part of their loan and exchange platform (which allowed them to loan the company USD and Bitcoin to the company in favor of some interests) they will return up to 40\% of their initial investment every month. After using broad marketing strategies to avoid their investors to know about their fraudulent intentions and recollecting thousands of investments, they closed the loan and exchange platform; so, all the people who invested in the BCC lost all their money because of the 96\% drop in the price of the coin. Even the company promised to return some money for the people who got affected by given them the average of the price of the coin in the last 15 days but, given that BCC was at such a low price there were several financial lossess by the investors. In this day and age, there are new companies like XRPConnect, EthConnect, Bunny Token and NEOConnect that are replicating the schemes that BCC made without any type of regulation which, as what happened with BitConnect, can lead to disastrous results \cite{nextWeb}.

\noindent In this manner, cryptocurrencies can over-inflate their price by artificially manipulating the price by marketing it with unrealistic expectations so people start buying the coin and in some delay, selling it to other people to obtain profit through the Exchanges or the Peer to Peer system, who would put more coins in the market through mining. As they exploit the price and people invest more in the coin, they then can abuse this by incrementing by a big margin their Exchange rate or, on the other side, the company changes the coins it possesses for USD or another currency and, proceed to devaluate their coin so they do not have to pay people back. \cite{bcc11}.

\noindent On the other hand, price leveraging is not as hard in cryptocurrencies as other stocks that are available in the market. An article written in the Journal of Monetary Economics about the price manipulation in the bitcoin system, that the sudden spike in the price of bitcoin in 2013 happened due to suspicious activity in an exchanges called ``Mt.Gox Bitcoin Currency Exchange'', which 600000 BTC valued at 188 million USD were acquiered using bots, artificially inflating the price without any real substance; the article explains how this could have a massive effect in the growth rate of BTC in a positive manner, reaching a 4\% growth rate each day after \cite{PMitBE}.

\subsection{Problem of cryptocurrencies}
Taking account of all the above, the cryptocurrency system allows for people to abuse it in fraudulent ways to augment the growth rate of the price of that coin without any type of repercusion, due to the lack of goverment regulation. On the other hand, as an articles of forbes says, most of investors in this currencies like this investment because of the same lack of government involvement \cite{forbes}. In this manner, nowadays companies like Bunny Token, ETH Connect, XRPConnect and mire are expecting 1\% growth in their price daily without any type of proof or security for the investors without too much control because, of the lack of control they have, leading to a easier atmosphere to scam people.

\indent To conclude, it's important to notice that even if the problem and the variables have a very short span, there can be found a lot of documentation about them because they were one of the trending topics last year. Most people see Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a safe economic investment and a way to make easy profit. Although we are not saying that is something that we should thrive to eliminate completely, it is important to examine how this system works and start to make policies that makes investing in this opportunity a safer place for the consumer and, stop catastrophes like BitConnect to don't ever happen again.
