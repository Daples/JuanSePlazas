\section{Conclusion \& future work}
The model constructed gives a general idea of how does a cryptocurrency exchange market work. On the other hand, the mathematical expressions used in the model could not be the ideal, since finding the optimal functions for the calculations needed was not the objective of this research; though, this can be left for future work. Additionally, the policies purposed are just some strategies, based on the model constructed, to give some regulation to the problem at hand; nevertheless, it should be noted that implementing these policies out in the real world can be a different research topic.

This paper was focused on giving a basis to a relationship between system dynamics and the cryptocurrencies world; therefore, this paper gives a basic grasp of how a model in this area can be constructed.
