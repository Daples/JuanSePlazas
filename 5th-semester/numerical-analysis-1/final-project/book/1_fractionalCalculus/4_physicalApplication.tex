\section{Real Phenomena with Fractional Models}
This section is intended to suggest the reader some evidence regarding the utility of fractional models in real world. This section is adapted from the work presented by Almeida \textit{et al.} in \cite{almeida2016modeling}.

\subsection{Population Growth}
In the paper, the authors consider the standard population growth approach (Malthusian Law). Let $P(t)$ be the population at an arbitrary time $t\geq0$, and $k$ a constant production rate, then 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
        P'(t)=kP(t)&\\
        P(0)=P_0&
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
is the model of the population through time. The exact solution to this initial value problem can be found with straight-forward integration, yielding 
\begin{equation}
    P(t)=P_0e^{kt}, \quad t\geq0
\end{equation}
As the authors proposed, the idea is to replace the standard differential operator for fractional Caputo-type derivatives. Hence, the fractional approach to the population growth model is 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
        \mathcal{D}_c^\alpha P(t)=kP(t)&\\
        P(0)=P_0&
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
