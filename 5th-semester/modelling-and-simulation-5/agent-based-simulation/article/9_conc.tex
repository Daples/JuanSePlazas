\section{CONCLUSIONS}
The present work shows that the implemented model represents the dynamics of healthy, risky and diabetic populations, under the influence of social relationships through BMI variation. 

Given that the diabetic population increases over time, we confirm the theories that affirm that diabetes is growing and can be considered as an emerging threat to public health.

As for future work, we propose that the decision rules can be reviewed formally. Additionally, we suggest that agents can learn and have a memory about their experience (previous states), for example, if an agent was diagnosed as diabetic in the past and it is currently recovered, it may have a large probability of eating constantly healthy.
