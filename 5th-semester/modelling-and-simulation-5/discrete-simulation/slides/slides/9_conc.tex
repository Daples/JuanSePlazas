\begin{itemize}
    \item The model does not fully represent the real system.
    \item There is a key factor in the real system that was not considered.
    \item The fitting distributions were closed to the real data.
    \item Higher deviations in the data.
    \item Using the implemented model, it is not possible to improve the waiting queue time of the real system.
