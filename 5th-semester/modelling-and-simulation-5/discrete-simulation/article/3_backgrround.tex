\section{BACKGROUND}
In the research done by \cite{shimshak1981priority}, they propose several queueing models to evaluate the effectiveness of them and improve waiting times, considering the theoretical background discussed in \cite{cobham1954priority}, where he claims the queue models can be classified in two types: single-channel and multiple-channel systems. It is important to remark that these results constitute a theoretical and preliminary background in the queue theory with priorities.

Returning to the ideas proposed in \cite{shimshak1981priority}, they use three different queueing schemes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Multiple server model queue with no priorities.
\item Priority discipline queueing model with two priorities.
\item Priority discipline queueing model with preemptive service.
\end{enumerate}
The main idea of said work is to analyze different the described alternatives to determine the effective work distribution of New Jersey Hospital pharmacy. Finally, a more recent application was introduced by \cite{ndukwe2011reducing}, where they apply queueing disciplines to improve the waiting times of outpatients in a Nigerian hospital, reducing the average waiting time from 167min to only 55.1min.
