\section{CONCLUSIONS}
It was successfully analyzed the received data, using statistical tests which allowed to fit data to use in the simulation, find auto-correlation and test homogeneity between data. It is important to remark that in the fitting of the data the distributions have a left bias as most of the times are positive and close to zero.

It was successfully implemented the simulation model in Python, which partially represents the Neurom√©dica pharmacy medicine retriveal system. The model did not fully validate with the tests done, which presents an important limitation of the implemented model; even though, the results given are not useful for the real system, this article proposes a methodology for solving this types of problems. 

For further work, a model using continuous simulation could be used as the inter-arrival times are so close to zero that the system could be analyzed supposing a continuous flux of patients. Also, a graphical user interface can be done so it is easily explained without the use of code.
