\begin{frame}{Design Criteria of the Data Structure}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The NashTable is based on hash tables and doubly linked lists; searching files is the priority.
    \item Although this first approach to solve the problem is not optimized for low memory consumption, it has been developed for optimize searching with different options.
    \item Hash tables were used since they are able to search for files in constant time.
    \item Double linked lists because insertion in the last position is achieved in constant time and also because they do not have a fixed size (unlike arrays), allowing the NashTable to add objects depending on the files indexed.
    \item Searching for files is independent from the amount of files indexed inside the structure. It just depends on the number of characters on the name.
