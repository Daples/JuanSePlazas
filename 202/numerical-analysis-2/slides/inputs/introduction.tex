\section{Introduction}
\aframe{
Suppose we have two substances $A$ and $B$ that reach chemically on some domain
$\Omega$ to produce $C$:
\[
A+B\rightarrow C.
\]
\begin{itemize}
  \item First-order reaction: rate proportional to the concentrations of $A$
  and $B$.
  \item The formed substance $C$ decays spontaneously with rate proportional to
  its concetration.
  \item We use $u_1$, $u_2$ and $u_3$ to denote the concentrations of $A$, $B$
  and $C$.
\end{itemize}
