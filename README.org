#+TITLE: Mathematical Engineering
#+AUTHOR: Daivd Plazas Escudero and Juan Sebastián Cárdenas Rodríguez

In this repository, most of the exams, presentations and works can be found for
most of the subjects of the Mathematical Engineering program of EAFIT. In most
cases, both authors' work is given. They are ordered by semester as given by the
following study plan:

For simplicity, only the latex source code was added as it is more helpful for
any other student that would like to have some guide in the different works. On
the other hand, it is important to realize that the syllabus for each of the
subjects may differ and this repository will not be updated with the new plans
as both of the authors already graduated from the program.

It is important to remark, that not all the works given in this repository are
perfect therefore some mistakes will be found for each work. If any notorious
mistake is found, you can create a pull request or contact us directly for the
change.

Lastly, for future work many of the latex source code files will be cleaned of
trailing white space and tabs characters; furthermore, each file will be fitted
to an 80 column width. It is important to notice that many of the early codes
are disorganized as the author were starting and therefore did not had any
notion of organization.
