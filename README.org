most of the subjects of the Mathematical Engineering program of EAFIT. They are
ordered by semester as given by the following study plan:

For simplicity, only the latex source code was added as it is more helpful for

subjects may differ and this repository will not be updated with the new plans
as both of the authors already graduated from the program.
