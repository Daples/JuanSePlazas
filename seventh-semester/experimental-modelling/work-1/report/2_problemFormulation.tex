\section{Problem Formulation}\label{sec:probForm}
As previously mentioned, the output of the PV system is an stochastic process. The standard approach to forecasting the behavior of this system has been modelled using ARIMA models, using only information of the past of the same system, but it does not take into consideration the external environmental factors that may affect the power output \cite{li2014armax}; as for the problem of this particular work, the main objective is to simulate the ARMAX model proposed in \cite{li2014armax} with different noise distributions, particularly with outlier behavior and show that it is not always adequate to assume normality of some random processes.
