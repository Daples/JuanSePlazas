\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conc}
In this article, an ARMAX model was successfully
simulated. Furthermore, it was seen the impact that different
distributions for the stochastic noise can have in the behavior of a
time series. At the same time, it is important to remark the
importance of historical data to make comparisons as the model in this
paper did not have similar values to the one in \cite{li2014armax}. This probably occurred because the values for the noise that the original paper used are not specified.
