\subsection{General ARMAX model}

As previously mentioned, this work uses an ARMAX model presented in the literature; hereby, let the general ARMAX model be presented:
\begin{equation}
    z_{t+1}=\sum_{i=0}^{h_1}a_iz_{t-i}+\sum_{i=0}^{h_2}b_iu_{t-i}+\sum_{i=0}^{h_3}c_i\xi_{t-i}
\end{equation}
for $t=0,1,2,\ldots$, and $u_k$ are external inputs and $\xi_k$ are random noises. In this particular case, the model obtained in \cite{li2014armax} is:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} z_{t}=& 237.565+0.426z_{t-1}+\xi_{t}-0.153 \xi_{t-1}+8.9087u_{1, t} \\ &-1.557 u_{7, t}+31.919 u_{8, t}-2.045u_{9, t}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $z_t$ is the power output of the PV grid in Watts (W); $u_{1,t}$ is the daily average temperature, $u_{7,t}$ is the precipitation amount, $u_{8,t}$ is the insolation duration and $u_{9,t}$ is the humidity.
