\subsection{General ARMAX model}

As previously mentioned, this work uses an ARMAX model presented in the literature; hereby, let the general ARMAX model be presented:
\begin{equation}
    z_{t+1}=\sum_{i=0}^{h_1}a_iz_{t-i}+\sum_{i=0}^{h_2}b_iu_{t-i}+\sum_{i=0}^{h_3}c_i\xi_{t-i}
\end{equation}
for $t=0,1,2,\ldots$, and $u_k$ are external inputs and $\xi_k$ are random noises.
