The graphs obtained by measuring time to resolve of each algorithm  match at a good scale
the theoric values. The differences can be explained because the big o notation only takes 
consideration to values that tend to infinity and, actually, altough the used values are 
considerably big there are other terms that may affect the behaviour of the curve.
