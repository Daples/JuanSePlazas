3.3 The matrix representation is more useful when the important things are the
connections, not the weights; so, in a simple graph the matrix representation
is a fairly good approach to represent it better. But, the priority is to use 
''greedy algorithms'' or a really big sample of data de linked list 
representation is much better.

3.5 It's better to use the linked list representation because, of the big size
of the data (so we can optimize memory) and this type of data is a priority to
search for smallest path and more.
