Metodo:
def maxspan(array):
	arr = []
	max = 0
	for i in range(len(array)):
		for j in range(i,len(array)):
			if array[i] == array[j]:
				c = j-i+1
		arr.append(c)
	for i in range(len(arr)):
		if arr[i] > max:
			max = arr[i]
return max

It works fairly easy. First for every data in the array of integers it moves
through the same array to the same index through the end of the array
searching for the number again. If it finds it again it sets the variable "c"
to the numbers it has between them; it does this until the array ends.
