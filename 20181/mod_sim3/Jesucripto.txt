Refuerzo:

R1: CC Bought --> Price --> Growth Rate --> Investors --> CC Bought
Title: Amount of CC bought due to investors.
This loop explains how the price increases due to the purchase of new CC; because the growth is defined as a change in a period of time, it is clear that it will increment as well. Now, as the CC is growing, more people will be interested in investing, which implies more CC bought.

R2: Exchange Fees --> Earnings --> CC Bought --> CC Sold --> Exchange Fees
Title:  Amount of CC bought due to earnings.
This reinforcing loop explains how the exchange fees affect the amount of CC bought due to their earnings, which, in a future, will be sold; and this implies a change on the exchange fees because the selling procedure is though a exchange house.

R3: Exchange Fees --> Earnings --> CC Bought --> Exchanges --> Exchange fees
Title: Earnings due to exchanges and their fees.
Let's us imagine a market with a lot of exchanges, in order to compete with the other exchange houses, they will have to reduce their fees; therefore, people will obtain higher revenue. This encourages people to buy more CCs.

R4: Exchange Fees --> Investors --> CC Bought --> Exchanges --> Exchange Fees
Title: Investors due to exchange fees.
This is similar to last loop, since the exchange fees determines the number of investors there will be; and they, as well, determine the number of CC bought. As we said, the number of CC bought influences the number of exchange houses and, due to market competition they will have to change their fees.

R5: CC Bought --> CC Sold --> Price --> CC Bought
Title: Delay between purchase and sell of a CC.
The price defines both the amount of CC bought and sold; if, in the future, there are more CC bought, it will produce more sells.


R6: CC Bought --> CC Sold --> Price --> Growth Rate --> Volatility --> Investors --> CC Bought
Title:
If we define the volatility as the risk of an investment, if there is more, there will be less investors and CC bought; therefore, there will not be an increment in the CC sold and the price will increase. Clearly, the growth rate will increase as well.


Balance:
B1: CC Bought --> Price && viceversa
Title:


B2: CC Bought --> CC Sold --> Price --> Growth Rate --> Investors --> CC Bought
Title: Price regulation.
If the


//Variables
1)
CC Bought --> CC sold: When consumers buy a CC in order to, in the future, sell it to earn profit.
CC Bought --> Price: If consumers start buying more of that CC, the price will augment.
CC Bought --> Exchanges: An increment in the number of CC bought, Exchanges will more likely trade that CC.


2)
Price --> CC Bought: If the price increases, consumer cannot afford as much CC as before.
Price --> Growth Rate: A decrease in the price of the CC implies that the growth reduces.


3)
Growth Rate --> Investors: When the CC is growing faster, human beings invest more to gain more profit.
Growth Rate --> CC Bought: If the growth rate increases, consumers will buy more of that CC.
Growth Rate --> Volatility: An increment in the growth rate will generate an increase in the volatility.


4)
Investors --> CC Bought: If there are more investors due to the fact that they bought more CC.


5)
Exchange Fees --> Earnings: A decrease in the exchange fees, increment the earnings of the consumer.
Exchange Fees --> Investors: If the exchange fees increase, people will invest less because it does not generate
utilities.


6)
Earnings --> CC Bought: If consumers earn more so they can afford buying more.


7)
Government taxes --> Exchanges: An increment in the government taxes will, in a period of time, reduce the number of
exchanges because the reduce rentability.
Government taxes --> Exchange fees: If the government taxes increase, Exchanges need to increase their fees to balance
the cost.


8)
Exchanges --> Exchange fees: When the number of Exchanges augment, they need to reduce their fees in order to overcome the
competition.


9)
Volatility --> Investors: A positive change in volatility will reduce the number of investors.


10)
CC Sold --> Exchange fees: An increase in the number of CC sold, the fees of the Exchanges will decrease.
CC Sold --> Price: If the number of CC sold increases, the price reduces.
