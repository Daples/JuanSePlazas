\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conc}
In this work, a linear approximation to the RÃ¶ssler circuit proposed by \cite{canals2014random} was successfully proposed for an interval of the input of $u \in [1000V, 1200V]$ in a selected operation point with initial conditions $(0.5228,-2.6140,2.6140)$ and initial input of $u_0 = 1000V$; this model was constructed and analyzed based on the theory and procedures presented in section \ref{sec:meth}, all the results obtained were shown and properly explained and justified. Furthermore, a valid discrete system was found and verified with the same procedures. In this results, the stability region for parameter $R_a$ was $[184.7341k\Omega,\infty)$, which makes sense, since higher values for this resistor would make small average voltage in the circuit and clearly the linear system cannot have unstable behavior. On the other hand, even though the order reduction was not completely successful, a second order linear system is easier to implement in a real life circuit; it was also found that the order reduction works fairly well for certain inputs. Finally, it was verified that the Bode diagram is a powerful tool to analyze the output for sine wave inputs and a concise way of presenting the information about a system; lastly, it is useful to determine the closed-loop stability in of the system for certain gains and delays, information that is necessary for further work in control design and beyond.
