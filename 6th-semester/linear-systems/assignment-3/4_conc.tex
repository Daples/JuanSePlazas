\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conc}
In this work, a linear control to the RÃ¶ssler circuit proposed by \cite{canals2014random} was successfully designed with the procedures presented in section \ref{sec:meth}, and then tested under different conditions. Although, some approaches (Ziegler-Nichols and Chien-Hrones-Reswick) did not provide good approximations for the discrete PID controller, the sensitivity and analytic methods showed proper behavior for certain intervals of the inputs and the $R_a$ parameter, usually with an upper bound of $u_{ub} = 1.5$ and $R_a = 3000$, achieving absolute stability and eliminating steady-state error for a step and ramp input.
